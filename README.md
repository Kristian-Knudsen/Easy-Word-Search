# Easy Word Search #

## As of this date (19-05-19) im not currently developing the script nor keeping it up to date! ## 

---

An easy way to search through a subfolder or directory to find words by keyword. The way to use this script is thorugh 2 ways. Either is the same result:
- Download/clone the python script (main.py) and run through CMD on local PC. Running the script in any folder shouldn't be a problem, as the script allows for selection of the folder you want to search in.
- Downloading the .exe file. (Not currently available) and running it on your local PC. Running this in a any folder shouldn't be a problem, again because it allows for searching to a different folder.

This script can only search in .docx files, but im working on expanding the possibilities!

## In progress ##
Currently working on following ideas
- Complete GUI solution
- Allowing for a root folder to be searched thorugh with all its subfolders
- More efficient search algorithm
- Possible to search through multiple fileformats.

## Warning ##
I take no responsibility WHAT SO EVER, for any usage of this script. A function of this script allows for transformation of .doc files to .docx files! Please use with caution.
